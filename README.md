## 🧑‍💻 About me

- Engineer / tinkerer blending **hardware, embedded systems, and web**.
- Focused on **IoT for agriculture & water management** – loggers, sensors, connectivity, and data that actually helps decisions.
- Works across **microcontrollers**, professional embedded platforms, and modern web stacks.
- Always looking for that sweet spot where **reliable field hardware** meets **usable software**.

---

## 🔧 Tech I enjoy

- **Embedded & Devices:** C/C++, microcontrollers, low-power design, industrial/field deployments  
- **Backend & Services:** Python, Node.js, REST APIs, data processing pipelines  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, React  
- **Data & Dashboards:** MongoDB / Postgres, analytics, visualizations for irrigation and operations  
- **Automation & Ops:** Git, GitHub, automated CI/CD pipelines, testing, and reproducible builds

---

## 👀 Current obsessions

- Building **robust field loggers** that survive dust, heat, and neglect – and still send useful data home.
- Designing **clean UIs for tiny screens and dashboards** so people get the info they need in seconds.
- Exploring **wireless protocols and connectivity** to make remote sites feel a bit less remote.
- Helping teams and growers **stay focused* on the task at hand** instead of wrestling with tools. (*Focus doesn't apply to me...)

## 🚀 Things I’ve built / am building

- 🌧️ **Irrigation & soil-moisture tooling** – firmware, scripts, and dashboards to make scheduling and monitoring more straightforward.
- 📟 **Connected devices** – smart loggers and gateways with intuitive interfaces and responsive controls.
- 📊 **Web dashboards & apps** – bringing together probes, weather, and operational data into simple, clear views.
- 🧩 **Utilities & experiments** – small tools, prototypes, and proof-of-concepts that often grow into something bigger.

---

## 🧠 How I like to work

- Start with a practical prototype and **iterate toward reliability and polish**.
- Balance **real-world constraints** (power, range, weather, time, mud) with **rubust harware design, good UX and maintainable (by me) code**.
- Automate the repetitive parts so more time goes into **solving real problems**.
- Keep it fun – curiosity, experimentation, and a bit of playfulness make better systems in the long run.
- Will absolutely over-engineer a solution if it means learning something interesting.

---

## 🏓  Outside the code

- Enjoys **padel** and anything that gets me moving outdoors.
- Big fan of good coffee and long problem-solving sessions.
- Happy place: bridging the gap between **physical systems** and **useful software**.
